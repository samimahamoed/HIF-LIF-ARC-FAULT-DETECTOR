srv \- serial communication 
The module is responsible for external serial communications\&.
.PP
Here, two interface helper functions are provided for data transmission and reading incoming message (see \fBserial_send_response()\fP, serial_get_command(,,))\&.
.PP
In these application only algorithim module can access these functions\&. Basically the implemented operation principle is that, during receiver interrupt the module collects incoming data to receive buffer and sends interrupt notification to algorithm module after successful validation procedure (see _U1RXInterrupt())\&. On the other hand, for data transmission request the module copies the message to transmit buffer and starts sending out data on every transmit interrupt (see _U1TXInterrupt())\&. Here, sending can be configured in blocking mode or non-blocking mode\&. In the latter case data which can?t fit into the buffer will be lost (see serial_send(,))\&. Whereas, in the first case (the default) the serial message will be blocking till the transmission is completed\&. However, this doesn?t affect protection functionality serviced by high priority interrupt\&.
