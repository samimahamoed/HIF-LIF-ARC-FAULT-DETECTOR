This is simple event based O\+S.

Rather scheduler then real operating system.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each module has to provide\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Task event function
\item Task notification function
\item Variable for module handle.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Task event function will receive synchronous calls with events distributed by O\+S. Task notification function will receive asynchronous calls from other modules ( routed through notification distribution function). Notification functions are not allowed to call other notification functions, they are allowed to schedule events only ( if the operation cannot be executed immediately).
\item There is no preemption, everything is voulntary. There is only one common stack. There is no need for synchronisation in event tasks ( as only one is run at once). Only notification function have to be designed with care as they are called while other module is running.
\item The system provides timer scheduling -\/ on expiration notification will be sent. Such timer can be rearmed to get periodical operation.
\item Interrupt functions can schedule special notification to be sent to notification function. Such function must determine itself cause of the interrupt ( nothing extra is passed)
\item The system sends initial notification to each module

\item typical module -\/ see \hyperlink{a00038}{algorithm.\+c} file
